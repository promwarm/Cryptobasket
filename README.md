# Cryptobasket

Cryptobasket will be a portfolio manager for cryptocurrencies.
The goal would be to generate monthly reports, set alerts and automatically store daily prices.

Current version:
> Shows a menu
> Asks for a ticker
> Returns a JSON with current prices in BTC and USD

Thanks for your support!
